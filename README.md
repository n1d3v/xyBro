![banner](https://github.com/xyqnn/xyBro/assets/135556230/ae53d648-0f3a-46dd-8aac-5af185af5cc2)
xyBro is a browser based on PyQt5 and PyQtWebEngine.
This is a fun project I am making (credits to @BaamBuus for this idea, check him out)
Want to build or run this? Install these dependencies using pip.
```python
pip install PyQt5 PyQtWebEngine
```
# How?
PyQtWebEngine is the backend of the browser and handles HTML, CSS, JS etc. 
PyQt5 is the UI backend of the browser. I am going to learn a bunch of 
stuff from this project and it is going to be fun.
# Other Platforms?
You can try the .py file and extract the .zip for icons before launching
the py file. Can't say it will work for you but give it a go.
# Todo
✅ = Finished
☑️ = Some what finished
❌ = Not finished / implemented
- Working Downloads ☑️ (No Download Manager and some issues (mentioned in release.))
- Good Icons and UI ☑️ (Buggy UI but mostly finished.)
- Cookies Encryption ☑️ (Cookies Work but no encryption.)
- Other Icons ✅
- Icons embedded in .exe and not outside the .exe ❌
