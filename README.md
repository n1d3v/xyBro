# xyBro (BETA!!)
xyBro is a browser based on PyQt5 and PyQtWebBrowser.
This is a fun project I am making (credits to @BaamBuus for this idea, check him out)
Want to build or run this? Install these dependencies using pip.
```python
pip install PyQt5 PyQtWebEngine
```
# How?
PyQtWebEngine is the backend of the browser and handles HTML, CSS, JS etc. 
PyQt5 is the UI backend of the browser. I am going to learn a bunch of 
stuff from this project and it is going to be fun.
